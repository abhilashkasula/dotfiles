# My Dotfiles

Dotfiles for:

* [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
* [emacs](https://emacsformacosx.com/)
* [atom](https://atom.io/)
* [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)

These are primarily for the Mac OS. It might work on *nix systems, but I haven't tried.

### vim

Once you have installed vim, running install_vim.sh will make sure [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is installed.


### TODO

Add scripts to automate installation of:

* homebrew
* vim (including brew installing it)
* emacs
* zsh
* oh-my-zsh
* leiningen
* clojure
